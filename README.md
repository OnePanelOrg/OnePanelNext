# OnePanelNext

OnePanel is an app that allow you to read your favorite Manga, one panel at a time

We belive in this new reading experience, in between the old Manga reading and watching an Anime

The panels will be displayed one by one, allowing the reader to dedicate the right amount of time to each panel, without spoiling the rest of the page!

## Technologies
OnePanelNext is a complete rewrite of the OnePanel project in Next.js
This will allow a future proofing of the project and *maybe* an increased number of contribution


This is a [T3 Stack](https://create.t3.gg/) project bootstrapped with `create-t3-app`.

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org)
- [NextAuth.js](https://next-auth.js.org)
- [Prisma](https://prisma.io)
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com)
- [tRPC](https://trpc.io)

## How do I deploy this?

Will likely deploy on [Vercel](https://create.t3.gg/en/deployment/vercel)
